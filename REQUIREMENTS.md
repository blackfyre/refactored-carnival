The task is to implement a web-app. Youâ€™re free to choose the technologies, frameworks and libraries that you want to solve the task, however we expect that you adhere to the following points:

- [x] Create REST endpoints for providing the data resources exposed below.
- [ ] Create a functionality to render the publishing item and enable the UI to create,update and delete - items.
- [ ] Create a graph page rendering the reach data, using a library like d3.js or Highcharts
- [ ] Create a websocket implementation and push the data to connected clients when a new publication is - created.
- [ ] Create a websocket implementation and add data points to the reach graph in real time.
- [ ] The deliverable should be accessible from a GitHub repository (private or public)
- [ ] Optional: Implement the solution in Typescript
- [ ] Optional: Deliver the solution in a Dockerized setup


We're looking for that:
* All tasks are solved in the solution
* The application has a solid commit history
* The application is built with scalability and maintainability in mind
* The application is built for testability, demonstrated by actual tests
* Your solution reflects a sense of quality you would be confident in releasing to production
* Documentation is applied to code / repository describing intent and purpose, as well as complicated / non obvious choices in the implementation
